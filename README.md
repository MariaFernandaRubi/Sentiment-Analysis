# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis with Probability Scores from Comments using Python with Pysentimiento

## 📖 Objective
The objective of this project is to **analyze customer comments and classify them as positive or negative using sentiment analysis (NLP)**.  
The study also calculates the percentage and ratio of positive vs. negative comments, providing insights into overall customer sentiment.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook):** For data analysis, predictive modeling, and visualization in an interactive environment.  
- **pandas:** For structuring, cleaning, and manipulating tabular data efficiently using DataFrames.  
- **pysentimiento:** For performing sentiment analysis and text classification (NLP) to interpret customer opinions and reviews.  
- **matplotlib:** For building customizable charts such as line, bar, histogram, and scatter plots.  
- **seaborn:** For creating professional and statistical visualizations (heatmaps, boxplots, regression plots) with an elegant style.  

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Synthetic dataset of customer comments created for this analysis.  
- **Attributes:**  
  - `Comment` → customer feedback text  

## 🔎 Process
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Created synthetic comments directly in Python.  
   - Structured the dataset into a DataFrame with comments and sentiment labels.  

2. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Used **pysentimiento** to classify comments as positive or negative.  
   - Generated a sentiment column to store model predictions.  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Built a bar chart to compare the number of positive vs. negative comments.  
   - Calculated percentages of each sentiment type.  
   - Computed the **positive-to-negative ratio** to summarize overall sentiment.  

## 📈 Results
- Majority of comments were classified as **positive**, with a smaller portion identified as negative.  
- Percentage distribution between positive and negative comments clearly displayed.  
- The ratio provided a quick indicator of customer satisfaction balance.  
- Visualizations allowed for a clear understanding of sentiment proportions.
